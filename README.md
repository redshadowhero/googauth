# About googauth
================

googauth is a CLI frontend that generates google-authenticator pin codes from a secret key. The concept is originally based on [James Cuff's google authenticator](http://blog.jcuff.net/2011/02/cli-java-based-google-authenticator.html)

## Compiling
============

Compiling should be as easy as ```make``` (but do check out some of the other build targets!); there are no dependencies.

## License and Copyright
========================

All the files in include/google and everything sans main.c in src is Â© Google and licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Thanks

* Special thanks to James Cuff for coming up with the java version of this, and you should totally check out the GUI version of his client, [jauth](http://blog.jcuff.net/2011/02/cli-java-based-google-authenticator.html)
* Google for making a wonderful open-source product and allowing us to hack away at it!
